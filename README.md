This project is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Tech Garden is a space where I cultivate and share my tech tools, development notes, and handy references. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this is a place to explore, learn, and maybe find a nugget of knowledge that resonates with you.

## Motivation

As a developer, I often found myself juggling between multiple tabs, searching for the same information, and drowning in the vast sea of online resources. Tech Garden emerged from the desire to create a personal space where I could consolidate my learnings, document my experiences, and have a go-to reference for _tech stuff_.
