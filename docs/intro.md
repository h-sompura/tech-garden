# Tech Garden

👋 Welcome to Tech Garden, my little corner on the internet where I stash away all my tech thoughts and helpful stuff. 🌾

## Disclaimer ⚠️

I've planted my collection of _tech stuff_ on here. Although this is pretty opinionated, some content on here might be outdated or won’t work for every scenario, so grab what works for you! 🍀

If you’d like to report/suggest any content, you can add them <u>_[here.](https://github.com/harshithasompura/tech-garden/issues)_</u>

## What to expect

A mix of topics ranging from software dev, AI, go-to tools, personal docs, random notes of all things **tech**. 🌱

With that said, feel free to take a stroll through Tech Garden. 💻

## Happy exploring! 🔍🌿
